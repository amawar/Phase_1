Imdb titles.csv: has numerous movies by the genres
Bom.csv – has numerous movies by the gross value, domestic and foreign
***

Both data above were merged, and top 5 genres by the domestic gross value were extracted
***

## Results

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

### Visual 1

### Visual 2
![graph2]((./images/graph2.png)

## Conclusions

There is a high demand for Action movies in the market, followed by Adventure and Comedy. However, we will need to further analyse and find out the reason behind this demand; could it be the price, the quality or is it just pure demand for it in the market.
